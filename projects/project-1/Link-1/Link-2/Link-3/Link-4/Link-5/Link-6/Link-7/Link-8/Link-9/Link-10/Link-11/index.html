        <h1>So anyways,</h1>
        <h1>here's how I think of the rest of the year to make it go by a little faster.</h1>
        <p>- March is basically done because of Spring Break.</p>
        <p>- The first two weeks of April will go by fast because of midterms and I'll be designing for club events then.</p>
        <p>- The next two weeks of April I'll be recovering from the first two weeks.</p>
        <p>- The first two weeks of May will probably be spent scrambling for finals.</p>
        <p>- The second two weeks of May I'll be overloaded with moveout and confirming my summer job.</p>
        <h2>then I'll be all done and on my way home!</h2>
